## Description
Explain what the project does.
Encrypts and Decrypts a picture using a linear shift feedback register by randomly modifying red green and blue values in a given picture.

### Features
Describe what your major decisions were and why you did things that way.
I created functions to convert a string of bits into a decimal and back into a string. Although I did not need the function to convert a decimal to binary, converting to a decimal was useful. I included the ctime library so I could get a new random string each time I run the program.

### Issues
What doesn't work.  Be honest.  You might be penalized if you claim something works and it doesn't.

### Extra Credit
Anything special you did.  This is required to earn bonus points.
